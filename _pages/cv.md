# Bio

I am a junior student major in computer science at USTC and also a member of the AI talent class. My research interests includes machine learning, natural language processing, and data mining.

# Educations

2016/07-Now \|  Computer Science, SCGY, University of Science and Technology of China

2019/07-2019/10  \|  Research Intern at Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles

# Research Experience

- Key Laboratory of Big Data Analysis and Application \| USTC            

  **Apr 2018-present**

  **Advisor**: Professor Enhong Chen, School of Computer Science and Technology, USTC

  **Project**: Multi-modal Neural machine translation with reinforcement learning methods

- - The main task is to train a better translation model with the image description dataset that are much easier to obtain but hard to use than traditional multi-lingual dataset;
  - Conducted literature research on neural machine translation systems and reinforcement learning methods;
  - Design a novel reward function based on the image caption model to complete the reinforcement learning;
  - Experimentally implemented a novel neural machine translation system based on google transformer, and built image caption model on the pretrained translation model to generate the reward for reinforcement learning.
  - Have submitted the paper to ACL.

- National Engineering Laboratory for Speech and Language Information Processing \| USTC 

  **May 2018- present**

  **Advisor**: Professor Wu Guo, School of Information Science and Technology, USTC

  **Project**: Speech emotion classification based on Speech spectrograms

  - The main task is to do emotion classification, I mainly conducted the experiment and propose some ideas to improve the results;
  - Conducted literature research and get familiar with the iemocap database;
  - Replicated the theoretical derivation and program implementation in the classic papers;
  - Conducted different experiments on the server to derive optimized parameters;
  - Currently working on further implementation, and the development of neural network algorithms.

# Works
