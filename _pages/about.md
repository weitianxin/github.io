Student of AI talent class

**I am actively looking for a Ph.D. position, please feel free to contact me if interested!**


# Bio

I am a senior student major in computer science at School of the Gifted Young, USTC and also a member of the AI talent class. My research interests includes data mining, natural language processing, and machine learning. 

Today, all kinds of mainstream supervised learning tasks have achieved great performance. However, after this, data becomes the most important bottleneck. Based on my previous experience, there are three critical challenges: 1) Since annotated data is difficult to obtain, how to learn effective information from unlabeled data? 2) Deep learning models rely heavily on statistical correlations. How can models be made to reason more intelligently? 3) The effect of deep learning models depends to some extent on the bias in the data. How to eliminate such bias and make models more robust and fair? To address these issues, first I would like to research designing more effective self-supervised and unsupervised learning tasks. Then I want to deepen my knowledge of causal inference and empower models with counterfactual thinking and intelligent inference. Causal inference techniques and adversarial training techniques can also help train more unbiased and fair models.
