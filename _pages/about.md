Student of AI talent class

**I am actively looking for a Ph.D. position, please feel free to contact me if interested!**


# Bio

I am a senior student major in computer science at School of the Gifted Young, USTC and also a member of the AI talent class. My research interests includes data mining, natural language processing, and machine learning. 

Today, all kinds of mainstream supervised learning tasks have achieved great performance. However, after this, problems about data have become the most important bottleneck. To address such issues, I do research in the following three directions. First I leveraged the knowledge of causal inference and empower models with counterfactual thinking and intelligent inference. Second I designed algorithms that eliminate bias in data mining and make models more robust and fair. Third, I integrated heterogeneous information to train the multi-modal models. Last I focused on learning effective information from unlabeled data, e.g. self-supervised learning and unsupervised learning.
